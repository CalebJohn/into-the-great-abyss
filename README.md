Contributing
-----------
This game is built with [godotengine](https://godotengine.org)

In order to contribute, [download](https://godotengine.org/download) the godot executable and load this project as usual. Please refer to the [docs](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) for tutorials and getting started.

Although style and code formatting is a very important aspect in project development, for the purposes of this prototype we will be focussing on content rather than quality in order to get a prototype finished as soon as possible.
